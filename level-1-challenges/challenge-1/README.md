In this challenge, you'll create a "hello world" JavaScript program.

## Steps

1. Download the project using the button at the bottom of this page.
2. Unzip the project. 
3. Open the project in your IDE, startup the development server, and visit the page in the browser (probably[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/))

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: If you need help starting up the development server and running this challenge in the browser see the lesson "How to Startup the Coding Challenges" in Chapter 0 of this training.

4. Open the file `src/main.js`
5. Add the following code to the file:

    ```
    alert("Hello World");
    ```
6. What happened? You should see an alert in the browser that says "Hello World". You can click "Ok" to dismiss it.

```

8. In the browser, nothing appears to happen but our message is just hiding.
