   Bitsy: {name: 'Bitsy', species: 'cat', mood: 0.6},
   Datastream: {name: 'Datastream', species: 'fish', mood: 0.5},
   Pixel: {name: 'Pixel', species: 'dog', mood: 0.8},
}

Glitch is in sanctuary: false

--Pet Report--

Name: Datastream, Species: fish, Mood: 0.5

```

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Remember to use different ways of accessing object properties (dot notation and square brackets) where appropriate. The `in` operator is useful for checking if a property exists, while `for...in` loops are great for iterating over all properties of an object.
