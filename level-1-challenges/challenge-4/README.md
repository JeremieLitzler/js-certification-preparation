# Data Types Challenge

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, let's play around with variables of various data types.

You'll write code within the file `src/main.js`

## Steps

1. Declare a variable called `jsIsAwesome` and set it to a boolean value of `true`
   1. Log it to the console
   2. Log the `typeof jsIsAwesome` to the console
2. Declare a variable called `firstName` and another called `lastName`. Use these values to build a string variable called `fullName`.
   1. Log all 3 variables to the console
   2. Log the `typeof fullName` to the console
3. Declare a variable `age` and set it to your current age
   1. Log it's value to the console
   2. Log the `typeof age` to the console
4. Declare a variable called `isOlderThan50` and set it's value to the following comparison: `age > 50`
   1. Log the `isOlderThan50` to the console
   2. Log the `typeof isOlderThan50` to the console
5. Declare a variable called `nothingToSeeHere` and don't assign it a value
   1. Log it's value to the console
   2. Log the the `typeof nothingToSeeHere` to the console
6. Declare a variable called `reasonsNotToLearnJavaScript` and set it's value to `null`
   1. Log it's value to the console
   2. Log the typeof `reasonsNotToLearnJavaScript` to the console

## What to Expect?

You should get the following logged to the console (we've added the comments below to describe what each log represents). Also download the solution, to compare your code with the official solution.

```
true // jsIsAwesome
boolean // typeof jsIsAwesome
John // firstName
Doe // lastName
John Doe // fullName
string // typeof fullName
30 // age
number // typeof age
false // isOlderThan50
boolean // typeof isOlderThan50
undefined // nothingToSeeHere
undefined // typeof nothingToSeeHere
null // reasonsNotToLearnJavaScript
object // typeof reasonsNotToLearnJavaScript
```
